Twitter News Trending(TNT)
Combining Networking and Sentiment Analysis I did this project.
For execution you need Twitter API and python libraries
In order to fetch tweets through Twitter API, one needs to register an App through their twitter account. Follow these steps for the same:
	Open this link https://apps.twitter.com/ and click the button: ‘Create New App’
	Fill the application details. You can leave the callback url field empty.
	Once the app is created, you will be redirected to the app page.
	Open the ‘Keys and Access Tokens’ tab.
	Copy ‘Consumer Key’, ‘Consumer Secret’, ‘Access token’ and ‘Access Token Secret’.
I did this project in Ubuntu, So you need to install python3.6 and library in python3.6
Python Libraries:
	pip install tweepy
	pip install textblob
	python -m textblob.download_corpora
